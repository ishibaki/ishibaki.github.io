I am interested in Development.

# Left-right asymmetric development in *Drosophila* embryo

I had studied about embryonic development by using *Drosphila*.

- [E and ID proteins regulate cell chirality and left–right asymmetric development in *Drosophila*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gtc.12669)
- [Chiral cell sliding drives left-right asymmetric organ twisting](https://elifesciences.org/articles/32506)
- [Cells with Broken Left–Right Symmetry: Roles of Intrinsic Cell Chirality in Left–Right Asymmetric Epithelial Morphogenesis](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/11/4/505)

# Post-embryonic development, caste differentiation, in termite

I am studying about the molecular mechanism of the caste differentiation by using termites.
Importantly, this is the developmental biology of a **Super-organism**.
