I am interested in Development.

# Left-right asymmetric morphogenesis

- I am elucidating mechanism by which the cell chirality emerges left-right asymmetric morphogenesis at the multi-cellular level by using cultured cell.
- I had studied about LR-asymmetric development by using *Drosphila* embryo.

# Post-embryonic development, caste differentiation, in termite

![Termites](../images/DSC_0943_balanced.jpg)

I had studied about the molecular mechanism of the caste differentiation by using termites.
Importantly, this is the developmental biology of the **Superorganism**.
