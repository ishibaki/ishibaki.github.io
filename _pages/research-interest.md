I am interested in Development.

# Left-right asymmetric development in *Drosophila* embryo

I had studied about embryonic development by using *Drosphila*.

# Post-embryonic development, caste differentiation, in termite

I am studying about the molecular mechanism of the caste differentiation by using termites.
Importantly, this is the developmental biology of a **Super-organism**.
